| Component         | Details                                    |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| OS                | Windows 10 or later                         |
| Browser           | Google Chrome (latest stable)               |

| Python            | 3.8 or later                                |
| Dependencies      | `selenium`, `openpyxl`                      |
| Test Data Source  | Hard-coded in script (items, names, zip)     |
| Network           | Stable internet connection                   |

## 4. Test Data
- **Credentials**:  
  - Username: `standard_user`  
  - Password: `secret_sauce`
- **Items to Add**:  
  - `add-to-cart-sauce-labs-backpack`  
  - `add-to-cart-sauce-labs-bike-light`  
  - `add-to-cart-sauce-labs-bolt-t-shirt`
- **Random Pools**: First names, last names, and 5-digit zip codes are generated from script lists.

## 5. Test Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Steps | Expected Result |
|----|---------|------|------------------|
| TC01 | Login | Launch Chrome ‚Üí Navigate to site ‚Üí Enter credentials ‚Üí Submit | User is redirected to Products page without error |
| TC02 | Add Items to Cart | For each item ID, click ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù | Each item button changes to ‚ÄúRemove‚Äù and cart badge increments |
| TC03 | Checkout Flow | Open cart ‚Üí Click Checkout ‚Üí Enter random details ‚Üí Continue ‚Üí Finish | Checkout completes and confirmation page displays |
| TC04 | Excel Logging | After each run, open `transactions_log.xlsx` | A new row is appended with purchase #, random names, zip, item list, and `SUCCESS` |
| TC05 | Loop Execution | Set `num_runs=20` and run script | Script completes 20 successful purchase cycles and closes browser |
| TC06 | Missing Excel File | Delete `transactions_log.xlsx` before run | Script creates new file with header row and first transaction logged |
| TC07 | Element Failure Handling | Temporarily change an item ID to an invalid value | Script prints warning and continues next item without crash |

---

## 6. Test Data Validation
- Verify each Excel row contains:
  - Sequential purchase number starting at 1.
  - Non-empty first and last name.
  - 5-digit zip code.
  - Comma-separated list of all 3 item IDs.
  - Status column = `SUCCESS` unless forced error.

---

## 7. Entry and Exit Criteria
**Entry**  
- ChromeDriver installed and path configured.  
- Python dependencies installed.  
- Internet access to https://www.saucedemo.com.

**Exit**  
- All test scenarios executed.  
- No unhandled exceptions in console.  
- Excel log reflects all executed runs.

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Swag Labs site downtime | Re-run when site is available |
| ChromeDriver version mismatch | Confirm driver version matches Chrome |
| Network instability | Ensure stable internet before execution |

---

## 9. Reporting
- Console output: real-time progress, warnings for missing elements.
- Excel file: persistent record of each transaction.
- Defects: capture console stack traces and Excel row anomalies.

---

## 10. Maintenance
- Update ChromeDriver when Chrome updates.
- Adjust selectors if Swag Labs UI changes.
- Parameterize item list or run count if test coverage changes.
